Command: java [-Xmx???M] -cp east.jar EAST

Arguments:
	Setting for screening stage: 
		args[0]: Number of starting points of local EM
		args[1]: Number of continued steps of local EM
		args[2]: Convergence threshold in loglikelihood
	Setting for evaluation stage:
		args[3]: Maximum number of candidate models to enter evaluation stage
		args[4]: Number of starting points of local EM
		args[5]: Number of continued steps of local EM
		args[6]: Convergence threshold in loglikelihood
	Setting for parameter optimization:
		args[7]: Number of starting points of full EM
		args[8]: Number of maximum steps of full EM
		args[9]: Convergence threshold in loglikelihood
	General setting: 
		args[10]: Path to data file (see 5k.data for format)
		args[11]: Path to ouput directory
		args[12]: Path to initial model (optional)
		args[13]: Conduct adjustment for initial model first or not (true/false, optional)

Example: $ java -Xmx1024M -cp east.jar EAST 4 10 0.1 50 16 20 0.1 32 100 0.1 5k.data . >& ./log.txt

This will take several minutes to finish the search process and output a set of intermediate models and a final model M.BIC.txt in the current directory. Note that the standard output during the search process will be redirected to the file log.txt in the current directory. 




Command: java -cp east.jar evaluateModel

Arguments: 
	args[0]: Path to model file
	args[1]: Path to data file

Example: $ java -cp east.jar evaluateModel model.bif 5k.data

The output is as follows:
LL: -35590.96717109195
BIC: -35722.9836655589
